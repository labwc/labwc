We are currently in the process of updating the code-base to use the
wlroots scene-graph API and have decided to use three branches at this
time:

- `v0.5` - the last minor release before the move to scene-graph. It is
  not envisaged that new major features will be added on that branch.

- `scene-graph` - where the active porting is taking place until it is
  merged into master at which point the scene-graph branch will be
  removed.

- `master` - which is mostly frozen to make the rebase/merge a bit
  easier.

## 0.5.1 - unreleased

### Fixed

- Implement cursor input for unmanaged xwayland surfaces outside their
  parent view. Without this menus extending outside the main application
  window do not receive mouse input. Written-by: @jlindgren90
- Allow dragging scrollbar or selecting text even when moving cursor
  outside of the window (issue #241). Written-by: @Consolatis
- Fix positioning of xwayland views with multiple queued configure
  events. Written-by: @Consolatis
- Force a pointer enter event on the surface below the cursor when
  cycling views (issue #162). Written-by: @Consolatis
- Fix qt application crash on touchpad scroll (issue #225).
  Written-by: @Consolatis

## [0.5.0] - 2022-02-18

As usual, this release contains a bunch of fixes and improvements, of
which the most notable feature-type changes are listed below. A big
thank you to @ARDiDo, @Consolatis and @jlindgren90 for much of the hard
work.

### Added

- Render overlay layer popups to support sfwbar (issue #239)
- Support HiDPI on-screen-display images for outputs with different scales
- Reload environment variables on SIGHUPi (issue #227)
- Add client menu
- Allow applications to start in fullscreen
- Add config option `<core><cycleViewPreview>` to preview the contents
  of each view when cycling through them (for example using alt-tab).
- Allow mouse movements to trigger SnapToEdge. When dragging a view, move
  the cursor outside an output to snap in that direction.
- Unmaximize on Move
- Support wlroots environment variable `WLR_{WL,X11}_OUTPUTS` for running
  in running nested in X11 or a wlroots compositor.
- Support pointer gestures (pinch/swipe)
- Adjust views to account for output layout changes

### Changed

This release contains the following two breaking changes:

- Disabling outputs now causes views to be re-arranged, so in the
  context of idle system power management (for example when using
  swaylock), it is no longer suitable to call wlr-randr {--off,--on}
  to enable/disable outputs.
- The "Drag" mouse-event and the unmaximize-on-move feature require
  slightly different `<mousebind>` settings to feel natural, so suggest
  updating any local `rc.xml` settings in accordance with
  `docs/rc.xml.all`

## [0.4.0] - 2021-12-31

Compile with wlroots 0.15.0

This release contains lots of internal changes, fixes and  new features.
A big thank you goes out to @ARDiDo, @bi4k8, @Joshua-Ashton,
@jlindgren90, @Consolatis, @telent and @apbryan. The most notable
feature-type changes are listed below.

### Added

- Add support for the following wayland protocols:
    - `pointer_constraints` and `relative_pointer` - mostly for gaming.
      Written-by: @Joshua-Ashton
    - `viewporter` - needed for some games to fake modesets.
      Written-by: @Joshua-Ashton
    - `wlr_input_inhibit`. This enables swaylock to be run.
      Written-by: @telent
    - `wlr_foreign_toplevel`. This enables controlling windows from clients
      such as waybar.
    - `idle` and `idle_inhibit` (Written-by: @ARDiDo)
- Support fullscreen mode.
- Support drag-and-drop. Written-by: @ARDiDo
- Add the following config options:
    - Load default keybinds on `<keyboard><default />`
    - `<keyboard><repeatRate>` and `<keyboard><repeatDelay>`
    - Specify distance between views and output edges with `<core><gap>`
    - `<core><adaptiveSync>`
    - Set menu item font with `<theme><font place="MenuItem">`
    - Allow `<theme><font>` without place="" attribute, thus enabling
      simpler config files
    - Support `<mousebind>` with `contexts` (e.g. `TitleBar`, `Left`,
      `TLCorner`, `Frame`), `buttons` (e.g. `left`, `right`), and
      `mouse actions` (e.g. `Press`, `DoubleClick`). Modifier keys are
      also supported to handle configurations such as `alt` + mouse button
      to move/resize windows. (Written-by: @bi4k8, @apbryan)
    - `<libinput>` configuration. Written-by: @ARDiDo
    - `<resistance><screenEdgeStrength>`
- Support for primary selection. Written-by: @telent
- Support 'alt-tab' on screen display when cycling between windows
  including going backwards by pressing `shift` (Written-by: @Joshua-Ashton)
  and cancelling with `escape` (Written-by: @jlindgren90)
- Add the following theme options:
    - set buttons colors individually (for iconify, close and maximize)
    - `window.(in)active.label.text.color`
    - `window.label.text.justify`
    - OSD colors
- Show application title in window decoration title bar
- Handle double click on window decoration title bar
- Support a 'resize-edges' area that is wider than than the visible
  window decoration. This makes it easier to grab edges to resize
  windows.

  'ToggleDecorations', 'ToggleFullscreen', 'SnapToEdge', 'Focus', 'Raise',
  'Move', 'MoveToEdge', 'Resize', 'PreviousWindow', 'ShowMenu'

- layer-shell:
    - Take into account exclusive areas of clients (such as panels) when
      maximizing windows
    - Support popups
- Handle xwayland `set_decorations` and xdg-shell-decoration requests.
  Written-by: @Joshua-Ashton

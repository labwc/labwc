# Configure output directives such as mode, position, scale and transform.
# Use wlr-randr to get your output names
# Example ~/.config/kanshi/config below:
#   profile {
#     output HDMI-A-1 position 1366,0
#     output eDP-1 position 0,0
#   }

# Launch a panel such as yambar or waybar.

# Enable notifications. Typically GNOME/KDE application notifications go
# through the org.freedesktop.Notifications D-Bus API and require a client such
# as mako to function correctly. Thunderbird is an example of this.

# Lock screen after 5 minutes; turn off display after another 5 minutes.
#
# Note that in the context of idle system power management, it is *NOT* a good
# idea to turn off displays by 'disabling outputs' for example by
# `wlr-randr --output <whatever> --off` because this re-arranges views
# (since a837fef). Instead use a wlr-output-power-management client such as
# https://git.sr.ht/~leon_plickat/wlopm

## Example ~/.config/labwc/environment file.
## Uncomment lines starting with one '#' to suit your needs.
##

##
## Use the XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT variable to set the keyboard layout. For example
## to start with Swedish keyboard layout set it to 'se'. If you are unsure what
## your country code is, refer to the layout section of:
## /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst
##
## Multiple keyboard layouts can be set by comma-separating the country codes.
## If a variant layout is needed, the syntax is layout(variant)
## If multiple layouts are used, specify the toggle-keybind using
## XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS as show below.
##
## For further details, see xkeyboard-config(7)
##

# XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=se
# XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=se,us(intl)
# XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=grp:alt_shift_toggle
# XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=grp:shift_caps_toggle

##
## Force Mozilla software like Firefox and Thunderbird to use wayland backend.
## Firefox (>= v121) enables Wayland by default, but we include this note here
## for those on non-rolling distributions.
##

# MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1

##
## Set cursor theme and size. Find system icons themes with:
## `find /usr/share/icons/ -type d -name "cursors"`
##

# XCURSOR_THEME=breeze_cursors
# XCURSOR_THEME=capitaine-cursors
# XCURSOR_SIZE=24

##
## Disable hardware cursors. Most users would not want to do this, but if you
## are experiencing issues with disappearing cursors, this might fix it.
##

# WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1

##
## In order for labwc to work out of the box, the environment variable below
## is set to "1" by default to avoid menus with incorrect offset and blank
## windows with Java applications such as JetBrains and Intellij Idea.
## See https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/595
## labwc will not override any already set environment variables, so if you for
## some reason do not want this, then just set it to "0" (not recommended, but
## mentioned here for completeness).
##

# _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=0

##
## This allows xdg-desktop-portal-wlr to function (e.g. for screen-recording).
## It is automatically set to "wlroots" by labwc though, so it is only
## includeded here for completeness. Again, labwc will not over-write an
## already set environment variable, so if you need it set to something else,
## then uncomment and adjust.
##

# XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=wlroots

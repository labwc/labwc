labwc-theme(5)

# NAME

labwc - theme files

# THEME

The theme engine aims to be compatible with openbox and themes will be
searched for in the following order:

- ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/
- $HOME/.themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/
- /usr/share/themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/
- /usr/local/share/themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/
- /opt/share/themes/<theme-name>/openbox-3/

When $XDG_DATA_HOME is defined, it replaces (rather than augments)
$HOME/.local/share. The same is the case for $XDG_DATA_DIRS and /usr/share/.

Choosing a theme is done by editing the <name> key in the <theme> section of
the rc.xml configuration file (labwc-config(5)).

A theme consists of a themerc file and optionally some titlebar icons (referred
to as buttons).

Theme settings specified in themerc can be overridden by creating a
'themerc-override' file in the configuration directory, which is normally
$HOME/.config/labwc/ but can be a few other locations as described in
labwc-config(5).

# DATA TYPES

	Colors can be specified by either of the following:

	Note: the #rrggbb aaa notation is deprecated starting from
	labwc 0.7.2 and may be removed in future releases.

*justification*
	Justification determines the horizontal alignment of text.
	Valid options are Left, Center and Right.

Note: Button elements (i.e. window.[in]active.button.\*) may be defined uniquely
for each type of button ("menu", "iconify", "max", "shade", "desk" or "close")
by appending the type after the "button" node. For example:

- window.active.button.iconify.unpressed.image.color indicates the color of the
iconify button for active windows; while

- window.inactive.button.close.unpressed.image.color indicates the color of the
close button for inactive windows.

popular themes. For the sake of brevity, these elements are not listed here, but
all are supported.

# BUTTONS

The images used for the titlebar icons are referred to as buttons.

The image formats listed below are supported. They are listed in order of
precedence, where the first format in the list is searched for first.

- png
- svg
- xbm

By default, buttons are 1-bit xbm (X Bitmaps). These are masks where 0=clear and
1=colored. The xbm image files are placed in the same directory as the themerc
file within a particular theme. The following xbm buttons are supported:

- max.xbm
- iconify.xbm
- close.xbm
- menu.xbm
- max_toggled.xbm
- desk.xbm
- desk_toggled.xbm
- shade.xbm
- shade_toggled.xbm

Additional icons can be defined to be shown when the mouse pointer is hovering
over the button in question:

- max_hover.xbm
- iconify_hover.xbm
- close_hover.xbm
- menu_hover.xbm
- max_toggled_hover.xbm
- desk_hover.xbm
- desk_toggle_hover.xbm
- shade_hover.xbm
- shade_toggle_hover.xbm

One advantage of xbm buttons over other formats is that they change color based
on the theme. Other formats use the suffices "-active" and "-inactive" to align
with the respective titlebar colors. For example: "close-active.png"

For compatibility reasons, the following alternative names are supported
for xbm files:

- max_hover_toggled.xbm for max_toggled_hover.xbm

When using png or svg icons, for a full theme experience all of the
following icons should be added:

- close-active.[png|svg]
- close_hover-active.[png|svg]
- close_hover-inactive.[png|svg]
- close-inactive.[png|svg]
- iconify-active.[png|svg]
- iconify_hover-active.[png|svg]
- iconify_hover-inactive.[png|svg]
- iconify-inactive.[png|svg]
- max-active.[png|svg]
- max_hover-active.[png|svg]
- max_hover-inactive.[png|svg]
- max-inactive.[png|svg]
- max_toggled-active.[png|svg]

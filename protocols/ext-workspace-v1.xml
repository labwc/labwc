    <description summary="list and control workspaces">
      Workspaces, also called virtual desktops, are groups of surfaces. A
      compositor with a concept of workspaces may only show some such groups of
      surfaces (those of 'active' workspaces) at a time. 'Activating' a
      workspace is a request for the compositor to display that workspace's
      surfaces as normal, whereas the compositor may hide or otherwise
      de-emphasise surfaces that are associated only with 'inactive' workspaces.
      Workspaces are grouped by which sets of outputs they correspond to, and
      may contain surfaces only from those outputs. In this way, it is possible
      for each output to have its own set of workspaces, or for all outputs (or
      any other arbitrary grouping) to share workspaces. Compositors may
      optionally conceptually arrange each group of workspaces in an
      N-dimensional grid.

      The purpose of this protocol is to enable the creation of taskbars and
      docks by providing them with a list of workspaces and their properties,
      and allowing them to activate and deactivate workspaces.

      After a client binds the ext_workspace_manager_v1, each workspace will be
      sent via the workspace event.

        All initial details of the workspace group (outputs) will be

        The client must send this request after it has finished sending other
        requests. The compositor must process a series of requests preceding a
        commit request atomically.

        This allows changes to the workspace properties to be seen as atomic,
        even if they happen via multiple events, and even if they involve
        multiple ext_workspace_handle_v1 objects, for example, deactivating one
        workspace and activating another.

        This allows changes to one or more ext_workspace_group_handle_v1
        properties and ext_workspace_handle_v1 properties
        to be seen as atomic, even if they happen via multiple events.
        In particular, an output moving from one workspace group to
        another sends an output_enter event and an output_leave event to the two
        ext_workspace_group_handle_v1 objects in question. The compositor sends
        the done event only after updating the output information in both
        workspace groups.

        The client must not send any requests after this one, doing so will raise a wl_display

    <description summary="a workspace group assigned to a set of outputs">
      A ext_workspace_group_handle_v1 object represents a workspace group
      that is assigned a set of outputs and contains a number of workspaces.

      The set of outputs assigned to the workspace group is conveyed to the client via
      output_enter and output_leave events, and its workspaces are conveyed with
      workspace events.

      For example, a compositor which has a set of workspaces for each output may
      advertise a workspace group (and its workspaces) per output, whereas a compositor
      where a workspace spans all outputs may advertise a single workspace group for all
      outputs.

      A ext_workspace_handle_v1 object represents a workspace that handles a

      Each workspace has:
      - a name, conveyed to the client with the name event

      coordinates event
      
      The client may request that the compositor activate or deactivate the workspace.

      Each workspace can belong to only a single workspace group.
      Depepending on the compositor policy, there might be workspaces with
      the same name in different workspace groups, but these workspaces are still
      separate (e.g. one of them might be active while the other is not).

        An id will never change during the lifetime of the `ext_workspace_handle_v1`
        and is guaranteed to be unique during it's lifetime.

        Ids are not human-readable and shouldn't be displayed, use `name` for that purpose.

        Compositors are expected to only send ids for workspaces likely stable across multiple
        sessions and can be used by clients to store preferences for workspaces. Workspaces without
        ids should be considered temporary and any data associated with them should be deleted once
        the respective object is lost.

        This event is used to organize workspaces into an N-dimensional grid
        within a workspace group, and if supported, is emitted immediately after
        the ext_workspace_handle_v1 is created and whenever the coordinates of
        the workspace change. Compositors may not send this event if they do not
        conceptually arrange workspaces in this way. If compositors simply
        number workspaces, without any geometric interpretation, they may send
        1D coordinates, which clients should not interpret as implying any
        geometry. Sending an empty array means that the compositor no longer
        orders the workspace geometrically.

        Coordinates have an arbitrary number of dimensions N with an uint32
        position along each dimension. By convention if N > 1, the first
        dimension is X, the second Y, the third Z, and so on. The compositor may
        chose to utilize these events for a more novel workspace layout
        convention, however. No guarantee is made about the grid being filled or
        bounded; there may be a workspace at coordinate 1 and another at
        coordinate 1000 and none in between. Within a workspace group, however,
        workspaces must have unique coordinates of equal dimensionality.

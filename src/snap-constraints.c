/*
 * When snapping to edges during a resize action, XDG clients can override the
 * desired size to honor arbitrary sizing constraints (*e.g.*, honoring some
 * aspect ratio or ensuring that a terminal window consists of an integer
 * number of character cells). In that case, the final position of the view
 * edge may fall short of the edge to which it's snapped.
 *
 * This can prevent a subsequent resize action in the same direction from ever
 * crossing the "missed" edge, because the next action will keep trying to hit
 * the edge and the client will overriding the desired size. To compensate,
 * every snapped resize will update a "last snapped" cache, recording the
 * view that was resized, the position (and orientation) of the resized edge,
 * and the expected geometry resulting from the snapped resize. At first, the
 * expected geometry is the "pending" geometry that will be sent in a configure
 * request. However, if the client overrides this pending geometry with some
 * other, constrained value, the expectation should be updated (only once!) to
 * reflect the size that the client chooses to honor.
 *
 * In subsequent snapped resize actions, if:
 *
 * 1. The view is the same as in the last attempted snapped resize;
 * 2. The direction of resizing is the same as in the last attempt; and
 * 3. The geometry of the view matches that expected from the last attempt;
 *
 * then the view geometry will be modified to reflect the *original* intended
 * geometry from last snapped resize, which will allow the current attempt to
 * progress beyond the "sticky" edge.
